5.0,Verified Purchase,if you're a runner- YES YES YES.,"invested in this because i finally had the money for decent wireless earbuds, and i saw great, detailed reviews from runners like myself. i am SO GLAD i did!Pros- never, EVER am i worried about these bad boys falling out of my ear. and i run hard- first run I had with these was an 8 mile run, and i was catching 100ft inclines in wind...they were AMAZING! if you're on the go, a runner, whatever, and you want something that will stay, this is for you! as far as noise-cancellation, i used them at work and it turned my loud coworker into a blissful, dim whisper! don't even get me started on the sound quality, especially the spatial surround...first song i heard made me tear up. sooo much better than what i'd been using before (basic wired lightning apple earbuds- hardy and reliable for about a year, but good for $20). battery life is AMAZING! i listened for 8 straight hours at work and only went to charge them when i went home, just because i had to put them back in the case. the case itself charged the earbuds at least 6 times before hitting 20% and i wanted to charge it just in case i needed it the next day (i will say, they weren't all 0 to 100% charges, more like the earbuds were down to 20-60% before i put em away, so you be the judge.) still, WAYYYY better than generic bluetooth earbuds that are obnoxious and die all the time. the earbuds also can work INDEPENDENT of each other! this includes noise cancellation! (so if you have a noisy coworker like me who sits on one side of you, and only one earbud is charged... you get it!) color is also true to advertising! beautiful lilac purple shade. and for range- just today I was doing laundry and didn't realize I had left my phone in my locked apartment one floor up and two large, closed rooms over until i was in the middle of moving a load to the dryer! seriously, it is POWERFUL.cons - they can hurt your ears if you leave them in for hours at a time, where the hooks rest. but for the quality...honestly, after an hour or two straight, just take a break! for noise cancellation, on runs it can make you feel like you're hitting altitude in an airplane, but DO NOT use noise cancellation on runs anyway! you need to hear cars and other potential hazards around you! and i haven't had issues with it on a treadmill, so this really isn't necessarily a con. :) they don't support wireless charging! and it only comes with a usbc (or whatever it's called) charger, neither end is a USB and it does not include a wall plug! however those you can buy for dirt cheap at walmart or meijer, so fret not. i usually use the usc slot on my work computer to charge mine. like others have said, case does feel a little flimsy so i might get a hard shell for it just in case.TLDR: if you're a runner, or have a noisy coworker, or on the go and want great sound quality and battery life, GET THEM! They are so worth the money."
5.0,Verified Purchase,Best wireless noise cancelling earbuds I have used so far,"I am a long-time user of the Bose QuietComfort 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones. These are my favorite noise cancelling option to use while taking walks. I like to listen to audio books while walking and the QuietComfort 20 are superb for this use. I also like to use a noise cancelling option while listening to audio books and podcasts in the car, especially because my car does not contain road noise well. I decided I would like to have a second QuietComfort 20 reserved for use in my car. An additional advantage to having a second one is if anything happens to the one I walk with, I'll have a backup. But, unfortunately, Bose discontinued the QuietComfort 20 forcing me to have to find another option for use in the car.I first purchased the wireless Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. But I found much to dislike about them. They feel heavy in the ears; the buds themselves just feel heavier and less comfortable than the QuietComfort 20 Headphones. I also disliked that every time I put the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds into my ears they speak to me telling me they are trying to connect to my device and also reporting battery state. I found this incredibly annoying. Another thing I hugely disliked was that there is an uncomfortable ""boom boom"" sensation as I walk with them in. I wear Vibram FiveFinger shoes and do not walk with a heavy gait. I do not get this ""boom boom"" sensation when walking with the QuietComfort 20 headphones. I also disliked how big the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds' case was. I disliked how the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds sometimes felt like they weren't secure in my ears and when I would try to adjust their stability I would accidentally change the noise cancellation setting. On two occasions, an uncomfortable high pitched sound emitted from one of the buds; it only lasted for a couple seconds but it was annoying. I tried using the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds for a month and never could bring myself to like them, so I returned them. I now have a strong dislike for Bose, primarily because they discontinued my beloved QuietComfort 20 Headphones. But up until recently, I was a huge Bose fan.I purchased Apple AirPods Pro. I immediately fell in love with the H1 chip operation. But I didn't like the color white. I also didn't like the stalk that extends down. But I started using them thinking I had found my noise cancelling option for the car. And although the AirPods Pro delivered some ""boom boom"" sensation while walking, it was much much better than the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. Then I started to become aware of a huge problem with the AirPods Pro. They would not stay in my ears. I would place them in ear, hear the noise cancellation activate and then in time the noise cancellation would turn off because one of the pods had pushed out of my ear enough to cause the noise cancellation function to disengage. I found myself constantly having to push them into my ear in an effort to keep them from pushing out. A couple times they plain fell out of my ears. I consulted instructionals on how to properly insert them into my ears for proper fit. I also did the fit test and passed the test indicating I had good seal. Only the seal wouldn't last and the pods would eventually push out of my ears. So I had to return the AirPods Pro because they wouldn't stay in my ears.I purchased some non noise cancelling earbuds thinking that a passive seal would be enough, but I found a number of problems with this option. I didn't like shoving thing way into my ear. Not only was it a little uncomfortable, but I also wondered about the sanitariness of touching (e.g., foam inserts) prior to shoving them into my ear. Maybe this could lead to ear infection? Also, the amount of sound isolation was too good which diminished my situational awareness while walking and/or driving. So passive noise block earbuds weren't solving my use need.I was worried there was no option for the car and I would not have a backup to my beloved QuietComfort 20 headphones. I really wish I could buy another pair of QuietComfort 20 headphones just to have a backup for the future. After delaying and delaying, I decided to go to the trouble to try one last option for the car: the Beats Fit Pro. Eureka!The Beats Fit Pro are fantastic! They have the H1 chip, which is awesome. They fit and feel way better than the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds and are super secure in my ears, unlike the AirPods Pro. The Beats Fit Pro feel so light to wear. I can wear them all day and there is no discomfort. They also have a button to cycle through the noise cancellation options, which I like a lot better than the tapping that was needed on the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. I also like the button press on the Beats Fit Pro better than the stalk-squeeze on the AirPods Pro.The one edge that I might say the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds have over the others is the noise cancellation. The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds arguably provide more intense noise cancellation that results in more of a bass presence and a sense that the content being played is closer to you. However, there is a cost to this that I don't think is worth it. The biggest cost for me was the ""boom boom"" sensation while walking. I don't know exactly what is to blame for this but it completely ruins the earbuds for what I want to use them for. I found the fit and noise cancellation of the Beats Fit Pro to be better suited to my needs.I wrote this to help others in their quest to find the earbuds that work best for them. I strongly recommend giving the Beats Fit Pro a try. I like them a lot. I think many others will too.ADDENDUM (added 2022-NOV): My beloved wired Bose QuietComfort 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones stopped working a few weeks ago. I purchased the wired Bose Headphones many, many years ago and used them a lot, so it was not unexpected. Fortunately, the Beats Fit Pro have been able to replace the wired Headphones for my daily walks. The Beats Fit Pro have minimal ""boom boom"" sensation while stepping/walking. Although the Beats Fit Pro have more ""boom boom"" than the wired Bose Headphones, the ""boom boom"" is minimal and much, much better than offered by the wireless Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. I have been using the Beats Fit Pro in cold weather lately and discovered that the physical side button on the Beats Fit Pro works fantastically when wearing a hat. For example, if I am wearing a thick knit winter hat, I can still activate the side button on the Beats Fit Pro by pushing on the outside of the hat. This can't be done with a touch-operation ""button"" like found on the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds.  The AirPods Pro ""button"" might be more difficult to operate with a hat on too. So if you are intending to use earbuds under a hat or hood, Beats Fit Pro will give you the advantage of still having full, easy use of the side button for play/pause operation from outside the hat."
4.0,Verified Purchase,Good Apple Ecosystem Option for Running,"Before buying the Beats Fit Pro, I've owned the PowerBeats Pro and AirPods Pro 2.  I'm a runner that wants an Apple ecosystem option that has decent sound quality and won't fall out of my ear.  After two runs and a trip to the gym, I'm happy with them so far.  Out of the three options above, I consider them the best option for running.  My quick thoughts on each:The PowerBeats Pro has been out for two or three years now and I'm surprised there hasn't been an updated model.  They're good earbuds for runners...when they work.  And the when they work part is infuriating.  The earbuds have to line up perfectly with the charging connections in the case or they won't charge.  I can't tell you how many times I've gone to use them and found one fully charged and the other dead.  There was even a potential class action lawsuit filed against Apple on that (search for it).  When they work, the PowerBeats Pro are solid because they hook around your ear.  You can have confidence when you run they're not going to fall out - I never had an issue in the two years or so I owned them with that.  There is also a physical button for changing songs and pausing the music and a rocker for changing the volume, which is convenient.  Cons: sound quality is ho hum in my opinion - it never feels like they secure cleanly in your ear.  Also, there's no wireless charging or noise cancellation.  Oh, and of course the infuriating charging issues.  I would not buy the PowerBeats Pro again for that reason.On to the AirPods Pro 2.  These earbuds have better sound quality in my opinion than both the PowerBeats Pro and Beats Fit Pro.  The noise cancellation meaningfully improved from gen 1 to gen 2.  There's wireless charging and a speaker installed in the case so you can ping them using the ""find my"" app on your iPhone.  For day to day use around the home or office, these earbuds are awesome.  However, at least for me, they're not for running.  While more secure than the regular AirPods, they still fall out of my ears sometimes and that certainly applies to running.  If you buy after market rubber hooks, Air Pods Pro 2 (and 1) will stay secure when running and provide a good experience (they don't fall out).  That said, having to attach the rubber hooks each time you go to run is a pain in the butt.The Beats Fit Pro makes some compromises, but in my opinion it's the best option for runners based on my limited experience so far.  The rubber wing tips ensure that the Beats Fit Pro has a secure fit in your ear.  They've felt secure running and haven't fallen out in my experience so far.  There's a physical button for changing the song, activating noise cancellation, and pausing the music.  Versus the PowerBeats Pro, there's no rubber hook so they're not as secure and there's no volume rocker.  However, they do have noise cancellation and fit more snugly in your ear.  As a result, I think the sound quality is a little better than the PowerBeats Pro, but not as good as the AirPods Pro 2.  On the downside, I think the case feels cheap compared to the AirPods, there's no wireless charging, and there's no speaker on the case for the ""find my"" app.  In addition, the case charges using USB C instead of lightning (btw, it's a USB C to USB C cable included with them and there's no power brick included).  USB C is coming to iPhone and I believe is already on iPad, but it's irritating that it has a USB C cable instead of lightning when your life revolves around lightning cables.In short, avoid the Powerbeats Pro - the charging issue is a design flaw and will lead to frustration over time.  The AirPods Pro 2 are awesome, but they're not a good option for running since they will fall out of many people's ears.  The Beats Fit Pro makes compromises, but in my experience so far its the best Apple ecosystem earbud for running."
4.0,Verified Purchase,"Amazing, But with a Few Cons","The Beats Fit Pro are amazing! I've tried earbuds that were twice the price as the Beats and felt like I was wasting my money in comparison. The Beats give you a better value for the money and are comfortable. After a few minutes, I almost forget that I'm wearing them. The battery life is very good. No complaints from anybody when I make phone calls with them. The sound quality is top notch, even with an Android. It's easy to switch between ANC (active noise canceling) and transparency with a press of the button on the earbuds.It's important to note though that in order to get the best sound quality, you will want to download the Beats app to your phone. It's available for both, Android and iPhone. In the app, scroll down and select ""Ear fit test."" It will play soft music briefly then determine if they are sealed properly. You can use this to reposition the earbuds in your ears for the best sound. Experiment with the different size tips that come with the Beats. Once you find the ones that are right for you, getting them in your ears properly will be a breeze. This may sound like a hassle, but it's not that bad. It only takes a minute and will be well worth it. If you don't go through this process, they will sound horrible.Aside from that, I do see a couple of cons. While the sound is amazing, the bass isn't quite as punchy as I had expected. Sometimes while listening to hip hop, I wish I could crank it up more. On the other hand, the bass is perfect for everything else. There is an equalizer in the app, but it's buried. I only found it a couple times and even then, the settings were limited. So I ended up using the preset to what sounded the most natural and left it at that. The volume doesn't go as high as I had expected either. But, I find that it's been about perfect, even if I do have to max out the volume on the phone at times. The case feels nice in the hand and hold the Beats securely. The hinge on the lid feels a little flimsy, so I'm always somewhat gentle with it. I definitely wouldn't recommend sticking the case in your back pocket where you'll sit on it.It would be nice if the app had more features and the case had a better hinge on the lid but overall, I appreciate the simple, straight-forward design. The Beats have never jiggled loose or fallen out of my ears during workouts. No earbuds are 100% perfect, but these come pretty close. My only regret is that I didn't order them sooner. For a minute there, I almost forgot about Dre!"
4.0,Verified Purchase,"It has one major flaw, accidental hang-up calls!","I am not overly impressed with this earbud set.It was a gift for my spouse, that’s the only reason I purchased it.LOOK:That Kim Kardashian color scheme will get old quick. Brand new they looked ok but after a few months, the case looks dirty and show scratches. The earbuds look ok and blend with the skin color which is kind of cool.SOUND QUALITY:Beats are known for their sound quality and although these deliver good sound quality, I’ve heard better quality from other Beats headphones. The noise cancellation is not the greatest which I expected that.BATTERY:Battery life is adequate for their size and the case provides multiple charges which is good.  Also, thank you Beads and Apple for using a USB-C to charge it. Most phones, tables, and electronics are all switching to USB-C finally dropping the the outdated Apple lightning cable and USB Mini.ACCIDENTAL HANGING UP CALLS:This is definitely a killer for me. I was gonna get a set for myself (the gray ones) but this one design flaw is a deal breaker for me.Once you have the earbuds in your ears you cannot touch them to adjust them if you are on a call. Every single time I used them on a call I accidentally hung up the calls every time I tried to adjust the earbud. I mean, these earbuds go into your ears but the fit is not always the best. As you move, walk, or even chew, the earbuds shift a little and when I tried to adjust them as I was on a call it would hang up the call. If you are listening to much, depending on which side you adjust, you would change the volume or pause the music.I hope Beads/Apple fixes this by changing the sensitivity of the touch or something."
4.0,Verified Purchase,Good for Apple ecosystem - not fully convinced at price point,"Pros: comfy for in-ear buds, especially for physical activity, works really nicely with Apple’s ecosystem including spatial audio, noise cancellation is very good as is transparency mode, sound quality is decent, can use one bud at a time if desired, USB-C charging. Cons: no multipoint connectivity, no wireless charging, water resistance rating lower than many other earbuds, battery life is barely adequate (both buds and charging case), outgoing audio voice quality is also just adequate.These are good earbuds, no question. But there are some maddening features skipped here that appear on much less expensive Bluetooth products. I still don’t understand why Apple’s Bluetooth audio products don’t include multipoint connectivity, even within their own ecosystem. My ancient Plantronics ear piece and my Bose headphones have had multipoint for years, and lack of it is really annoying when using the Beats for work purposes. Lack of wireless charging is less a concern for me, but is annoying at this price point if you’ve invested in the technology. The outgoing voice quality is probably fine for the form factor of the Beats, but it does sound like a telephone call when using Teams or Zoom rather than high quality audio. Biggest bug for me is these won’t make it through a full eight hour day of calls without a recharge, and the case only holds enough charge for 35 hours of use. I have a pair of Anker Life Dot 2s that are 5.5x less expensive with a 100 hour case that isn’t really any bigger. I realize many other buds won’t hit that eight hour mark either, so maybe it’s a complaint about the form factor.The sound quality is fine considering the Bluetooth codec used by Apple (either source or headphone) isn’t high def or even CD quality, despite what Apple might want you to think with the inclusion of spatial audio capability on the Beats. The drivers on the Beats are certainly acceptable for most users and given the mission and price point of the Beats, it’s about as good as anybody should expect. There’s room for improvement, but not much more without moving up in price or a change in codec use by Apple.One thing I did expect was a better water resistance rating. IPX4 is a little weak considering iPhones are at IP67.What I do really like is the noise cancellation (and transparency mode done well) of the Beats. Really works well. The earbuds are very comfortable to wear and get a good seal. The ear wings hold the earbuds in the ear without turning uncomfortable. Love the Apple ecosystem integration - these connect very easily with simple adjustments to iPhone and MacBook Pro alike.If you like the idea of AirPods Pro that fit better and stay in your ear more securely, you’ll probably like these. Again, for the price, these seem to hit most marks for what they are, which is a sort of Jack-of-all-trades Bluetooth earbud. Be sure to shop around if you value one specific element over another, like audio quality or battery life."
5.0,Verified Purchase,Great Fitness Headphones,"I purchased these to replace my Bose Soundsport Free headphones that stopped charging after 4 faithful years of use. I also own a pair of AirPods Pro headphones and felt like trying something in the Apple ecosystem after using various Bose headphones for my workouts over the last 10 years.The AirPods will not stay in my ears, and as a heavy sweater, I need earphones with the rubber wings to stop them sliding out. The Beats stay in perfectly fine and have a smaller profile than my Bose Soundsports did and the connectivity is seamless with my iPhone. If you have a set of AirPods these will be totally intuitive. The sound quality is identical to me and the Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) is a nice feature my old Bose headphones did not have, it does enough to drown out road noise and treadmill whirring. However, the ANC on these is not as good as AirPods and the sound quality while very close to AirPods, is perceptively lower (I really only notice if I go from listening to my AirPods to the Beats). The Beats are great if you need something for workouts and enjoy the Apple ecosystem, but if you’re just walking around town the AirPods Pro are better in almost every regard minus the staying in your ears. You can also adjust the volume on the Beats without using your phone, this is a massive plus if you are using them with Garmin fitness watches. I have music on my Garmin watch and nothing is worse than having to stop my run to cycle through my apps to turn my volume up or down (an obnoxious problem with AirPods).The only thing my old Bose headphones did better was durability for both the headphones and charging case. As other have pointed out the Beats case feels flimsy and cheap compared to an otherwise premium experience. I have dropped, sat on, and ran in rainstorms with my Bose headphones and never had any issues with water exposure. The portable Bose case feels much heavier and durable. While both the Beats and Bose headphones have the same IPX4 rating the Bose feel solid (this is just perception), however, the Bose were also bigger and heavier in my ears and I had ear fatigue after a few hours.If you need a quality sounding pair of fitness these are awesome. The market is saturated with wireless fitness earbuds and in most cases you won’t go wrong with name brands. However, these Beats checked the most boxes for me and as someone who is already well invested in the Apple ecosystem these were a no-brainer."
4.0,Verified Purchase,Fit my ears well,"This is my first pair of Bluetooth ear buds. Also first noise cancelling buds too.First, the good: they fit great! And they don’t hurt my ears even after a few hours wearing them. Maybe I have small ear canals but I had to remove the medium ear pads and use the smallest sized. No big deal since they provide three sizes but I was surprised the mediums didn’t fit and were too large.Second, they pair perfectly with my iPhone/iPad. Open the case when they’re next to my unlocked device…. BOOM…. They’re paired. Very simple.Third, the noise cancellation function works well. I can’t wait to try them on my next flight.The ONLY bad thing I have to say at this point in time is they didn’t come with a proper charging cord - meaning a cord with a standard USB plug on one end and USB-C on the other. They also don’t provide a 110v/USB plug adapter. All you get is a short cord with a USB-C plug on both ends. That’s totally useless. I had to “borrow “ the wife’s android charging cable to charge the case and buds. Fortunately that charge lasts a while. Long enough for me to get a proper USB/USB-C charging cable. I have sufficient 110v/USB adapters.All in all I’m very pleased with the sound quality, how they fit and overall comfort."
4.0,Verified Purchase,Very good fitness earbuds,"I got these earbuds for three reasons: I wanted something sweat-proof that would stay put on my finicky ears regardless of what kind of fitness training I'm doing, I wanted to have the same functionality as my Airpod pros, and I wanted to have a second pair of earbuds with a long-lasting battery for those end-to-end meetings days, where my Airpods just don't last long enough.This purchase pretty much fulfills my needs quite nicely:  The Beats Fit Pro fit my ears snuggly, and so far I have not been able to shake them off at all; not even make the budge a bit; and yet, they're amazingly comfortable.  They're very unobtrusive, even when lying down on my side and pressing my arm against my ear.The sound is very good, and while I have not really taxed the battery to the max yet, it does seem to last quite a long time. The specs say that each charge will last 6 hours, and I'm willing to believe it.The charger box is beautifully designed, and the earbuds fall into place with a very satisfying magnetic click, which ensures that the do not move from the box even if the box falls down with the lid open (great news for those who keep losing their earbuds!).The fact that I was able to get these for about $50 less than the Airpods Pro was a definite plus.As far as Apple compatibility is concerned, these work as advertised: instant recognition by all my Apple devices, smoothly switching from MacBook to iPhone to iPad; spatial sound, Find My - it all works.On the score-reduction side, I found it disappointing that the box does not charge wirelessly. Not a big deal, but it's just one of those little comfort details.The sound, while quite good, is definitely noticeably less crisp than with the Airpods. There seems to be a bit more emphasis on the bass, and a slight muffling of the sharp end that made feel less that thrilled with the output.Probably the most disappointing aspect is the active noise cancellation. It is there, it works, but it is far, far less effective than that provided by the Airpods Pro. I haven't had the opportunity to test them in something like an airplane yet, but just walking around the house and neighborhood, I can clearly hear a lot of noises that are almost completely drowned by the Airpods.  This even after trying the different silicone pad sizes and ensuring that the noise cancellation test indicated a ""perfect"" seal.I would, therefore, not recommend these for demanding audiophiles, or those seeking a deep isolation experience. But for the purpose I got them, as good, reliable, comfortable fitness earbuds, they're perfect."
4.0,Verified Purchase,"I LIKE THEM, but It's because it's what I was looking for","A 4 star rating is very fair for these, I wish I could give them a 4.5 though. While searching for new earbuds, I had three things that I was looking for. If you aren't looking for what I was, which it can be 50/50, then you may be better off going with another option (Like Bose).Grip, Comfortability, and Ease of Use.In terms of Grip, I wanted a pair of earbuds that would stay on my ear. If I were to go for a run, work out, or play basketball I wanted earbuds that would rarely or never fall out. I had recently had a pair of the AirPods Pro, and they DID NOT workout for me, as they would fall out of my ear VERY EASILY. With the Beats Fit Pro, the little wing tip that goes on the inner part of your ear, aside from the actual earbud that goes inside of your ear, actually provides GREAT grip, and I've been able to do my workouts without these falling off. I also thing that since these earbuds DO NOT STICK OUT OF YOUR EAR as much as a BOSE or AirPods Pro do, that it adds more grip to stay on your ear.In terms of comfortability, this should be fairly straight forward. I've had cheap earbuds were after an hour or so of wearing them, your ear starts to get very sore. So much so, that it even hurt to take them off. So far, the Beat Fit Pro earbuds have been pretty good so far. I played around with the different size earbuds that they provide, and have found the size for me. I did noticed that, you have to play around with how they fit in your ear in order to get that ""perfect fit"" we are all looking for. When I first put them on, I had to rotation the earbud and play around with where the wing tip would go, before I found the spot that works for me. I just recently went on a 4 hour flight, and throughout the whole trip, my ear did not get sore.Regarding the Ease of Use, it was very simple to connect the Beats, and it is also very simple to change the settings from Noise Canceling, to Transparency, to turning both of those off if you wish. You do not need to download an app or anything, which is amazing for me as I hate the earbuds where you need to download an app and create an account, etc. I give this a 5/5.Now, there are things that are not the best when it comes to the Beats Fit Pro, that I think other earbuds will work better.Sound, and Noise Cancelation.I would give the sound a 3.5/5. It is not the loudest, doesn't have the best bass, and it's not the most profound. What I mean by profound, is those headphones in which you can hear every sound that goes into a certain beat. This is where I think, that if an amazing sound is all you care about, then going with a Bose might be better for you. At it's loudest volume, the Beats Fit Pro are really not that loud. I've had headphones were you can't stay on the loudest volume because it's simply just to loud. It's kind of the opposite with the Beats. The loudest they go, is about how I like them when I listen to music.Now, the Noise Cancelation on the Beats Fit Pro DOES WORK. I tried them in my house, and had some of my friends talk to me, and I really could not hear a word they were saying. I like that in the Beats Fit Pro, it is VERY EASY to turn the Noise Canceling feature off. HOWEVER, when in a relatively medium sounding environment, the Beats Fit Pro, won't fully block out all the sound. Even worse, if you are in a large sounding environment, you will 100% be able to hear everything going on. This most likely has to do with the lack of sound that I was explaining on the previous paragraph. I feel that if the sound was louder and more profound on the Beats, the Noise Cancelation would be much better.If you happen to read my long description, I hope this help!"
