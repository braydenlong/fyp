5,Verified Purchase,Best wireless noise cancelling earbuds I have used so far,"I am a long-time user of the Bose QuietComfort 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones. These are my favorite noise cancelling option to use while taking walks. I like to listen to audio books while walking and the QuietComfort 20 are superb for this use. I also like to use a noise cancelling option while listening to audio books and podcasts in the car, especially because my car does not contain road noise well. I decided I would like to have a second QuietComfort 20 reserved for use in my car. An additional advantage to having a second one is if anything happens to the one I walk with, I'll have a backup. But, unfortunately, Bose discontinued the QuietComfort 20 forcing me to have to find another option for use in the car.I first purchased the wireless Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. But I found much to dislike about them. They feel heavy in the ears; the buds themselves just feel heavier and less comfortable than the QuietComfort 20 Headphones. I also disliked that every time I put the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds into my ears they speak to me telling me they are trying to connect to my device and also reporting battery state. I found this incredibly annoying. Another thing I hugely disliked was that there is an uncomfortable ""boom boom"" sensation as I walk with them in. I wear Vibram FiveFinger shoes and do not walk with a heavy gait. I do not get this ""boom boom"" sensation when walking with the QuietComfort 20 headphones. I also disliked how big the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds' case was. I disliked how the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds sometimes felt like they weren't secure in my ears and when I would try to adjust their stability I would accidentally change the noise cancellation setting. On two occasions, an uncomfortable high pitched sound emitted from one of the buds; it only lasted for a couple seconds but it was annoying. I tried using the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds for a month and never could bring myself to like them, so I returned them. I now have a strong dislike for Bose, primarily because they discontinued my beloved QuietComfort 20 Headphones. But up until recently, I was a huge Bose fan.I purchased Apple AirPods Pro. I immediately fell in love with the H1 chip operation. But I didn't like the color white. I also didn't like the stalk that extends down. But I started using them thinking I had found my noise cancelling option for the car. And although the AirPods Pro delivered some ""boom boom"" sensation while walking, it was much much better than the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. Then I started to become aware of a huge problem with the AirPods Pro. They would not stay in my ears. I would place them in ear, hear the noise cancellation activate and then in time the noise cancellation would turn off because one of the pods had pushed out of my ear enough to cause the noise cancellation function to disengage. I found myself constantly having to push them into my ear in an effort to keep them from pushing out. A couple times they plain fell out of my ears. I consulted instructionals on how to properly insert them into my ears for proper fit. I also did the fit test and passed the test indicating I had good seal. Only the seal wouldn't last and the pods would eventually push out of my ears. So I had to return the AirPods Pro because they wouldn't stay in my ears.I purchased some non noise cancelling earbuds thinking that a passive seal would be enough, but I found a number of problems with this option. I didn't like shoving thing way into my ear. Not only was it a little uncomfortable, but I also wondered about the sanitariness of touching (e.g., foam inserts) prior to shoving them into my ear. Maybe this could lead to ear infection? Also, the amount of sound isolation was too good which diminished my situational awareness while walking and/or driving. So passive noise block earbuds weren't solving my use need.I was worried there was no option for the car and I would not have a backup to my beloved QuietComfort 20 headphones. I really wish I could buy another pair of QuietComfort 20 headphones just to have a backup for the future. After delaying and delaying, I decided to go to the trouble to try one last option for the car: the Beats Fit Pro. Eureka!The Beats Fit Pro are fantastic! They have the H1 chip, which is awesome. They fit and feel way better than the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds and are super secure in my ears, unlike the AirPods Pro. The Beats Fit Pro feel so light to wear. I can wear them all day and there is no discomfort. They also have a button to cycle through the noise cancellation options, which I like a lot better than the tapping that was needed on the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. I also like the button press on the Beats Fit Pro better than the stalk-squeeze on the AirPods Pro.The one edge that I might say the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds have over the others is the noise cancellation. The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds arguably provide more intense noise cancellation that results in more of a bass presence and a sense that the content being played is closer to you. However, there is a cost to this that I don't think is worth it. The biggest cost for me was the ""boom boom"" sensation while walking. I don't know exactly what is to blame for this but it completely ruins the earbuds for what I want to use them for. I found the fit and noise cancellation of the Beats Fit Pro to be better suited to my needs.I wrote this to help others in their quest to find the earbuds that work best for them. I strongly recommend giving the Beats Fit Pro a try. I like them a lot. I think many others will too.ADDENDUM (added 2022-NOV): My beloved wired Bose QuietComfort 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones stopped working a few weeks ago. I purchased the wired Bose Headphones many, many years ago and used them a lot, so it was not unexpected. Fortunately, the Beats Fit Pro have been able to replace the wired Headphones for my daily walks. The Beats Fit Pro have minimal ""boom boom"" sensation while stepping/walking. Although the Beats Fit Pro have more ""boom boom"" than the wired Bose Headphones, the ""boom boom"" is minimal and much, much better than offered by the wireless Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. I have been using the Beats Fit Pro in cold weather lately and discovered that the physical side button on the Beats Fit Pro works fantastically when wearing a hat. For example, if I am wearing a thick knit winter hat, I can still activate the side button on the Beats Fit Pro by pushing on the outside of the hat. This can't be done with a touch-operation ""button"" like found on the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds.  The AirPods Pro ""button"" might be more difficult to operate with a hat on too. So if you are intending to use earbuds under a hat or hood, Beats Fit Pro will give you the advantage of still having full, easy use of the side button for play/pause operation from outside the hat."
4,Verified Purchase,Good Apple Ecosystem Option for Running,"Before buying the Beats Fit Pro, I've owned the PowerBeats Pro and AirPods Pro 2.  I'm a runner that wants an Apple ecosystem option that has decent sound quality and won't fall out of my ear.  After two runs and a trip to the gym, I'm happy with them so far.  Out of the three options above, I consider them the best option for running.  My quick thoughts on each:The PowerBeats Pro has been out for two or three years now and I'm surprised there hasn't been an updated model.  They're good earbuds for runners...when they work.  And the when they work part is infuriating.  The earbuds have to line up perfectly with the charging connections in the case or they won't charge.  I can't tell you how many times I've gone to use them and found one fully charged and the other dead.  There was even a potential class action lawsuit filed against Apple on that (search for it).  When they work, the PowerBeats Pro are solid because they hook around your ear.  You can have confidence when you run they're not going to fall out - I never had an issue in the two years or so I owned them with that.  There is also a physical button for changing songs and pausing the music and a rocker for changing the volume, which is convenient.  Cons: sound quality is ho hum in my opinion - it never feels like they secure cleanly in your ear.  Also, there's no wireless charging or noise cancellation.  Oh, and of course the infuriating charging issues.  I would not buy the PowerBeats Pro again for that reason.On to the AirPods Pro 2.  These earbuds have better sound quality in my opinion than both the PowerBeats Pro and Beats Fit Pro.  The noise cancellation meaningfully improved from gen 1 to gen 2.  There's wireless charging and a speaker installed in the case so you can ping them using the ""find my"" app on your iPhone.  For day to day use around the home or office, these earbuds are awesome.  However, at least for me, they're not for running.  While more secure than the regular AirPods, they still fall out of my ears sometimes and that certainly applies to running.  If you buy after market rubber hooks, Air Pods Pro 2 (and 1) will stay secure when running and provide a good experience (they don't fall out).  That said, having to attach the rubber hooks each time you go to run is a pain in the butt.The Beats Fit Pro makes some compromises, but in my opinion it's the best option for runners based on my limited experience so far.  The rubber wing tips ensure that the Beats Fit Pro has a secure fit in your ear.  They've felt secure running and haven't fallen out in my experience so far.  There's a physical button for changing the song, activating noise cancellation, and pausing the music.  Versus the PowerBeats Pro, there's no rubber hook so they're not as secure and there's no volume rocker.  However, they do have noise cancellation and fit more snugly in your ear.  As a result, I think the sound quality is a little better than the PowerBeats Pro, but not as good as the AirPods Pro 2.  On the downside, I think the case feels cheap compared to the AirPods, there's no wireless charging, and there's no speaker on the case for the ""find my"" app.  In addition, the case charges using USB C instead of lightning (btw, it's a USB C to USB C cable included with them and there's no power brick included).  USB C is coming to iPhone and I believe is already on iPad, but it's irritating that it has a USB C cable instead of lightning when your life revolves around lightning cables.In short, avoid the Powerbeats Pro - the charging issue is a design flaw and will lead to frustration over time.  The AirPods Pro 2 are awesome, but they're not a good option for running since they will fall out of many people's ears.  The Beats Fit Pro makes compromises, but in my experience so far its the best Apple ecosystem earbud for running."
4,Verified Purchase,"It has one major flaw, accidental hang-up calls!","I am not overly impressed with this earbud set.It was a gift for my spouse, thatâ€™s the only reason I purchased it.LOOK:That Kim Kardashian color scheme will get old quick. Brand new they looked ok but after a few months, the case looks dirty and show scratches. The earbuds look ok and blend with the skin color which is kind of cool.SOUND QUALITY:Beats are known for their sound quality and although these deliver good sound quality, Iâ€™ve heard better quality from other Beats headphones. The noise cancellation is not the greatest which I expected that.BATTERY:Battery life is adequate for their size and the case provides multiple charges which is good.  Also, thank you Beads and Apple for using a USB-C to charge it. Most phones, tables, and electronics are all switching to USB-C finally dropping the the outdated Apple lightning cable and USB Mini.ACCIDENTAL HANGING UP CALLS:This is definitely a killer for me. I was gonna get a set for myself (the gray ones) but this one design flaw is a deal breaker for me.Once you have the earbuds in your ears you cannot touch them to adjust them if you are on a call. Every single time I used them on a call I accidentally hung up the calls every time I tried to adjust the earbud. I mean, these earbuds go into your ears but the fit is not always the best. As you move, walk, or even chew, the earbuds shift a little and when I tried to adjust them as I was on a call it would hang up the call. If you are listening to much, depending on which side you adjust, you would change the volume or pause the music.I hope Beads/Apple fixes this by changing the sensitivity of the touch or something."
4,Verified Purchase,Good for Apple ecosystem - not fully convinced at price point,"Pros: comfy for in-ear buds, especially for physical activity, works really nicely with Appleâ€™s ecosystem including spatial audio, noise cancellation is very good as is transparency mode, sound quality is decent, can use one bud at a time if desired, USB-C charging. Cons: no multipoint connectivity, no wireless charging, water resistance rating lower than many other earbuds, battery life is barely adequate (both buds and charging case), outgoing audio voice quality is also just adequate.These are good earbuds, no question. But there are some maddening features skipped here that appear on much less expensive Bluetooth products. I still donâ€™t understand why Appleâ€™s Bluetooth audio products donâ€™t include multipoint connectivity, even within their own ecosystem. My ancient Plantronics ear piece and my Bose headphones have had multipoint for years, and lack of it is really annoying when using the Beats for work purposes. Lack of wireless charging is less a concern for me, but is annoying at this price point if youâ€™ve invested in the technology. The outgoing voice quality is probably fine for the form factor of the Beats, but it does sound like a telephone call when using Teams or Zoom rather than high quality audio. Biggest bug for me is these wonâ€™t make it through a full eight hour day of calls without a recharge, and the case only holds enough charge for 35 hours of use. I have a pair of Anker Life Dot 2s that are 5.5x less expensive with a 100 hour case that isnâ€™t really any bigger. I realize many other buds wonâ€™t hit that eight hour mark either, so maybe itâ€™s a complaint about the form factor.The sound quality is fine considering the Bluetooth codec used by Apple (either source or headphone) isnâ€™t high def or even CD quality, despite what Apple might want you to think with the inclusion of spatial audio capability on the Beats. The drivers on the Beats are certainly acceptable for most users and given the mission and price point of the Beats, itâ€™s about as good as anybody should expect. Thereâ€™s room for improvement, but not much more without moving up in price or a change in codec use by Apple.One thing I did expect was a better water resistance rating. IPX4 is a little weak considering iPhones are at IP67.What I do really like is the noise cancellation (and transparency mode done well) of the Beats. Really works well. The earbuds are very comfortable to wear and get a good seal. The ear wings hold the earbuds in the ear without turning uncomfortable. Love the Apple ecosystem integration - these connect very easily with simple adjustments to iPhone and MacBook Pro alike.If you like the idea of AirPods Pro that fit better and stay in your ear more securely, youâ€™ll probably like these. Again, for the price, these seem to hit most marks for what they are, which is a sort of Jack-of-all-trades Bluetooth earbud. Be sure to shop around if you value one specific element over another, like audio quality or battery life."
5,Verified Purchase,Great Fitness Headphones,"I purchased these to replace my Bose Soundsport Free headphones that stopped charging after 4 faithful years of use. I also own a pair of AirPods Pro headphones and felt like trying something in the Apple ecosystem after using various Bose headphones for my workouts over the last 10 years.The AirPods will not stay in my ears, and as a heavy sweater, I need earphones with the rubber wings to stop them sliding out. The Beats stay in perfectly fine and have a smaller profile than my Bose Soundsports did and the connectivity is seamless with my iPhone. If you have a set of AirPods these will be totally intuitive. The sound quality is identical to me and the Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) is a nice feature my old Bose headphones did not have, it does enough to drown out road noise and treadmill whirring. However, the ANC on these is not as good as AirPods and the sound quality while very close to AirPods, is perceptively lower (I really only notice if I go from listening to my AirPods to the Beats). The Beats are great if you need something for workouts and enjoy the Apple ecosystem, but if youâ€™re just walking around town the AirPods Pro are better in almost every regard minus the staying in your ears. You can also adjust the volume on the Beats without using your phone, this is a massive plus if you are using them with Garmin fitness watches. I have music on my Garmin watch and nothing is worse than having to stop my run to cycle through my apps to turn my volume up or down (an obnoxious problem with AirPods).The only thing my old Bose headphones did better was durability for both the headphones and charging case. As other have pointed out the Beats case feels flimsy and cheap compared to an otherwise premium experience. I have dropped, sat on, and ran in rainstorms with my Bose headphones and never had any issues with water exposure. The portable Bose case feels much heavier and durable. While both the Beats and Bose headphones have the same IPX4 rating the Bose feel solid (this is just perception), however, the Bose were also bigger and heavier in my ears and I had ear fatigue after a few hours.If you need a quality sounding pair of fitness these are awesome. The market is saturated with wireless fitness earbuds and in most cases you wonâ€™t go wrong with name brands. However, these Beats checked the most boxes for me and as someone who is already well invested in the Apple ecosystem these were a no-brainer."
4,Verified Purchase,Fit my ears well,"This is my first pair of Bluetooth ear buds. Also first noise cancelling buds too.First, the good: they fit great! And they donâ€™t hurt my ears even after a few hours wearing them. Maybe I have small ear canals but I had to remove the medium ear pads and use the smallest sized. No big deal since they provide three sizes but I was surprised the mediums didnâ€™t fit and were too large.Second, they pair perfectly with my iPhone/iPad. Open the case when theyâ€™re next to my unlocked deviceâ€¦. BOOMâ€¦. Theyâ€™re paired. Very simple.Third, the noise cancellation function works well. I canâ€™t wait to try them on my next flight.The ONLY bad thing I have to say at this point in time is they didnâ€™t come with a proper charging cord - meaning a cord with a standard USB plug on one end and USB-C on the other. They also donâ€™t provide a 110v/USB plug adapter. All you get is a short cord with a USB-C plug on both ends. Thatâ€™s totally useless. I had to â€œborrow â€œ the wifeâ€™s android charging cable to charge the case and buds. Fortunately that charge lasts a while. Long enough for me to get a proper USB/USB-C charging cable. I have sufficient 110v/USB adapters.All in all Iâ€™m very pleased with the sound quality, how they fit and overall comfort."
5,Verified Purchase,Extremely pleased with them.,"I've had these for two days now and I love them. My last pair of earbuds were the Jabra Elite 7 Pro and before that I used the Apple Air Pods. I definitely prefer these. I think the sound and fit work much better for me. I've used them at the gym and while doing chores around the house, they do not move and the sound quality is fantastic. .I primarily listen to EDM while working out so I was a little worried about how the bass would sound after reading some reviews, however I was ultimately pleased with how these performed. Sure it's not the same as using over the ear headphones but it gets the job done.I was also surprised by how good the ANC is on these. My wife and kids kept trying to ask me questions while I was wearing them doing the dishes I couldn't hear a word they were saying.I listen to a lot of podcasts around the house and with the ANC I don't have any issues with the hosts getting drowned out by external sounds.I also like that there is a range of color options I get tired of always having just black or white as an option.Overall I highly recommend them."
4,Verified Purchase,"I LIKE THEM, but It's because it's what I was looking for","A 4 star rating is very fair for these, I wish I could give them a 4.5 though. While searching for new earbuds, I had three things that I was looking for. If you aren't looking for what I was, which it can be 50/50, then you may be better off going with another option (Like Bose).Grip, Comfortability, and Ease of Use.In terms of Grip, I wanted a pair of earbuds that would stay on my ear. If I were to go for a run, work out, or play basketball I wanted earbuds that would rarely or never fall out. I had recently had a pair of the AirPods Pro, and they DID NOT workout for me, as they would fall out of my ear VERY EASILY. With the Beats Fit Pro, the little wing tip that goes on the inner part of your ear, aside from the actual earbud that goes inside of your ear, actually provides GREAT grip, and I've been able to do my workouts without these falling off. I also thing that since these earbuds DO NOT STICK OUT OF YOUR EAR as much as a BOSE or AirPods Pro do, that it adds more grip to stay on your ear.In terms of comfortability, this should be fairly straight forward. I've had cheap earbuds were after an hour or so of wearing them, your ear starts to get very sore. So much so, that it even hurt to take them off. So far, the Beat Fit Pro earbuds have been pretty good so far. I played around with the different size earbuds that they provide, and have found the size for me. I did noticed that, you have to play around with how they fit in your ear in order to get that ""perfect fit"" we are all looking for. When I first put them on, I had to rotation the earbud and play around with where the wing tip would go, before I found the spot that works for me. I just recently went on a 4 hour flight, and throughout the whole trip, my ear did not get sore.Regarding the Ease of Use, it was very simple to connect the Beats, and it is also very simple to change the settings from Noise Canceling, to Transparency, to turning both of those off if you wish. You do not need to download an app or anything, which is amazing for me as I hate the earbuds where you need to download an app and create an account, etc. I give this a 5/5.Now, there are things that are not the best when it comes to the Beats Fit Pro, that I think other earbuds will work better.Sound, and Noise Cancelation.I would give the sound a 3.5/5. It is not the loudest, doesn't have the best bass, and it's not the most profound. What I mean by profound, is those headphones in which you can hear every sound that goes into a certain beat. This is where I think, that if an amazing sound is all you care about, then going with a Bose might be better for you. At it's loudest volume, the Beats Fit Pro are really not that loud. I've had headphones were you can't stay on the loudest volume because it's simply just to loud. It's kind of the opposite with the Beats. The loudest they go, is about how I like them when I listen to music.Now, the Noise Cancelation on the Beats Fit Pro DOES WORK. I tried them in my house, and had some of my friends talk to me, and I really could not hear a word they were saying. I like that in the Beats Fit Pro, it is VERY EASY to turn the Noise Canceling feature off. HOWEVER, when in a relatively medium sounding environment, the Beats Fit Pro, won't fully block out all the sound. Even worse, if you are in a large sounding environment, you will 100% be able to hear everything going on. This most likely has to do with the lack of sound that I was explaining on the previous paragraph. I feel that if the sound was louder and more profound on the Beats, the Noise Cancelation would be much better.If you happen to read my long description, I hope this help!"
4,Verified Purchase,Very good fitness earbuds,"I got these earbuds for three reasons: I wanted something sweat-proof that would stay put on my finicky ears regardless of what kind of fitness training I'm doing, I wanted to have the same functionality as my Airpod pros, and I wanted to have a second pair of earbuds with a long-lasting battery for those end-to-end meetings days, where my Airpods just don't last long enough.This purchase pretty much fulfills my needs quite nicely:  The Beats Fit Pro fit my ears snuggly, and so far I have not been able to shake them off at all; not even make the budge a bit; and yet, they're amazingly comfortable.  They're very unobtrusive, even when lying down on my side and pressing my arm against my ear.The sound is very good, and while I have not really taxed the battery to the max yet, it does seem to last quite a long time. The specs say that each charge will last 6 hours, and I'm willing to believe it.The charger box is beautifully designed, and the earbuds fall into place with a very satisfying magnetic click, which ensures that the do not move from the box even if the box falls down with the lid open (great news for those who keep losing their earbuds!).The fact that I was able to get these for about $50 less than the Airpods Pro was a definite plus.As far as Apple compatibility is concerned, these work as advertised: instant recognition by all my Apple devices, smoothly switching from MacBook to iPhone to iPad; spatial sound, Find My - it all works.On the score-reduction side, I found it disappointing that the box does not charge wirelessly. Not a big deal, but it's just one of those little comfort details.The sound, while quite good, is definitely noticeably less crisp than with the Airpods. There seems to be a bit more emphasis on the bass, and a slight muffling of the sharp end that made feel less that thrilled with the output.Probably the most disappointing aspect is the active noise cancellation. It is there, it works, but it is far, far less effective than that provided by the Airpods Pro. I haven't had the opportunity to test them in something like an airplane yet, but just walking around the house and neighborhood, I can clearly hear a lot of noises that are almost completely drowned by the Airpods.  This even after trying the different silicone pad sizes and ensuring that the noise cancellation test indicated a ""perfect"" seal.I would, therefore, not recommend these for demanding audiophiles, or those seeking a deep isolation experience. But for the purpose I got them, as good, reliable, comfortable fitness earbuds, they're perfect."
5,Verified Purchase,Beats fit pro,"These are a work of art. They fit so comfortably in the ear, never fall out, connect to my iPhone right away without me having to do anything, the sound quality is CRISP and amazing (i feel like im in a recording studio), and they look really cool :) I couldn't be happier and I'm really glad I didn't re-purchase the Airpod Pros that I lost after a week of having them lol! I actually only use my Beats Pro on specific occasions - not for running everyday errands, because that's how I tend to lose them. I use them on long walks or runs, long train rides, talking on the phone around my house. When I know I won't be taking them out of my ears many times. If im running multiple errands (and mind you, i'm jumping on trams and ubers) or generally just having a hectic day outside, i'm using my other headphones, the Beats Flex wireless ones, because they have a cord that goes around my neck so I can easily pop the earphones out of my ears without concern of losing them. Anyway, I highly recommend the Beats Fit Pro earbuds, they are such high quality and I'm so happy I purchased them. Also, they came in my favourite color, lilac <3 - its a win for me :)"
4,Verified Purchase,Works great but having some little minor issues.,"I would rate this as 5 stars but......The beats fit pro I order a couple of weeks maybe a month in a half ago now I noticed that the left side of ear bugs had a slight issue with it charging, it stops at 93% but when plugged in it chargers well in facted but the right side works well so far. The slite problem is the left ear bug is the only problem, other than that it works fine, but I haven't tried resetting the ear bugs yet. Further information when I checked to see if it stops (left ear bug) I try taking it out then putting it back in to let it charge. It charges slowly over night. It only charges both side full battery when plugged in to the outlet. This is the second pare I order to far the first one I order didn't have to issue, in fact it still works fine but after having it's for the past 1y and 2 months the ear support tared for both sides I think it's from laying on them  all night, increasing the strain on the ear support. This is my report so far regarding my issue."
5,Verified Purchase,Compared to 4 other Earbuds...,"I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite.  Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros â€“ These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears.  But the best feature?  Physical â€œclickyâ€ buttons on each one of the buds.  You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature.  No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons â€“ The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldnâ€™t recommend to anyone with smaller ears.  The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special.  And this may be picky, but I didnâ€™t care for most of the color schemes available.  I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter â€œbâ€ in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros â€“ Very comfortable with the same great physically â€œclickyâ€ buttons as the Beats Fit Pro.  Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average.  Great base.  Classic look.Cons â€“ Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear.  The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros â€“ A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation.  With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in.  Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons â€“ Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didnâ€™t stay in during a workout.  They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear.  And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch.  The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear.  No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros â€“ Cost effective!  I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try.  If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons â€“ Poor fit for large ears.  These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldnâ€™t stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort  - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros â€“ Bose noise canceling is unmatched.  If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you.  The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base.  The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me.  Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder.  The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesnâ€™t open accidentally.Cons â€“ This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved.  The rubber inserts had more of a â€œflayedâ€ shape rather than the â€œroundedâ€ shape that is standard.  My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip.  The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation.  They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite?  The beats fit pro!  While I wouldnâ€™t recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine.  My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts.  The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didnâ€™t realize how desperately I needed."
5,Verified Purchase,Pretty good -battery could be better,"I really wish they would develop beats earbuds that last 12 hours without charging like my beats solos used to. These last about 5-6 hours without charging if you're not using the special features. When you are, it's only about 3 hrs without charging. I like that I can use them individually and it doesn't freak out when I switch earbuds. I also really like the audio - the audio is clear, bass is excellent, and they connect to my iphone/ipad/whatever automatically depending on which is playing sound. So I could be watching something on my ipad, and someone will call, and the audio will automatically switch to my iphone when I answer. That's a great feature. I'm a pretty loyal beats customer, I've always really liked the sound quality, and I'm a sound snob - I grew up in a musical family, so I know good sound when I hear it. These have good sound. It's like being there."
5,Verified Purchase,â€œBeatsâ€ my expectations,"I was super hesitant about dropping $200 on headphones but I was tired of subpar headphones that constantly fell out of my ears at the gym.I figured Iâ€™d try these for the wingtip plus I wanted to check out the noise cancellation and transparency mode since every time Iâ€™d talk to someone in the gym with my old earbuds Iâ€™d have to take them out. Iâ€™m blown away by these Beats Pro Fit earbuds! All of the features exceeded my expectations! The sound is crisp and the bass hits hard. I have smaller than normal ears and these fit great with the included small ear tips and they DONâ€™T fall out of my earsâ€¦..EVER. The only negative thing I can say is about the cheap feeling case, which it seems is mutual amongst other reviewers. If youâ€™re hesitating on buying theseâ€¦just go for it!"
5,Verified Purchase,Stay in my ear perfectly,"I found these after trying and returning the more expensive Apple AirPods Pro 2. These sound every bit as good in my opinion (musician but not audiophile) and stay in my ears for the toughest workouts. They keep a low profile so I donâ€™t have issues with winter hats like with my old Bose, but Iâ€™d say they fall short on comfort compared to the Bose. I could wear my Bose sport earbuds all day and barely notice them, but I wanted something with noise cancellation. I also tried the Bose quietcomfort earbuds: these are not as good for noise cancellation or comfort, but they donâ€™t stick out as far and cost quite a bit less.I had trouble finding the right balance of features for me for quite a while, so Hopefully I helped answer some questions for you!"
5,Verified Purchase,Better than you think!!,"(no compensation received for this review)I spent some time before I wrote a review because I had a hard time adapting to these over my Bose. Bose has undoubtedly the most comfortable ear tips. These were not initially comfortable and hurt my ears after long use.The fit - if you stick with it and let your ears adapt a bit, you will be fine (few weeks). I can wear these until they die during days with conference calls without a problem. I've ran a half marathon, cycled, rowed thousands of meters and never need to adjust them. They just stay.The connection - these just connect to everything without any hassle. I always had problems with my Bose where I was constantly struggling to get them to connect. The beats use the same tech as the Airpods Pro and connect.ANC - the noise cancelling is amazing. They might not be industry leading, but they are amazing IMO. Even on a plane they block out everything and I could watch movies or listen to music without ever hearing announcements.Sound - I think these sound much better than my Bose. The entire sound profile sounds so rich. Capitalizing on Apple's spatial audio tech, these have the same great sound stage as the Airpods Pros, but remain in place no matter what I'm doing.Battery life - can use these for hours without incident. I use them a lot for conference calls because of the noise cancelling and mic quality and they last for about 5 hours. Calls are the only way I was able to kill them. I popped them back in the case for 15-20 minutes and I was able to keep working without incident. The battery life with regular music is amazing. Recently had an 8 hour travel day and they still had 30% with almost constant use.I recommend these if you want something other than Bose. I can't compare to Sony, but I suspect they are as good. I bought Airpods Pros and were amazed with the tech but had to return because they constantly fell out. These are the swiss army knife of headphones for me and do everything well. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
4,Verified Purchase,Overall great but long term comfort will be a issue,"My main concerns was will it really stay in the ear, and for the most part I believe so. Comfort after time will be a factor and you will feel it. The case quality could be better and I wish the charge would last longer. The design and how it looks on the ear could look better I think but not bad I guess.Good things, the noise cancellation is next level, it removes about 85% of it. You can really tell the difference in a noisy room. The sound quality is great but my old loop around the ear beats quality was better. Overall I would recommend them at least to try because I think you will be impressed still."
5,Verified Purchase,Better than the AirPods Pro? I definitely think so!,"First off these are the first airpods Iâ€™ve owned, but not my first experience with airpods, and I must say that I made the right choice! I never quite liked the AirPods Proâ€¦ theyâ€™re not secure for sweaty people like me in workouts and Iâ€™m sure those white tips must get discolored with ear wax after a while (gross). Now the top 3 airpods right now are the airpods gen 3, AirPods Pro, and these bad boys (the beats fit pro)â€¦ my spouse has the Gen 3 (she got them after I ordered these) and I must say that they are more comfortable to useâ€¦ you could keep those in all day and barely even feel them, and theyâ€™re pretty secure (at least in my ears), Iâ€™ve never actually worked out in them before though.The Beats are the most secure airpods you can buy no doubt thoughâ€¦ no matter the ear size or shape, these guys arenâ€™t going anywhere once you fix those wing tips. The wing tips though start to poke your ear after a while so you start to feel them after a couple hours. No big deal thoughâ€¦ especially since you really donâ€™t really need to use the wing tips unless youâ€™re active. They stay in your ear pretty nicely in normal use without the wing tipsâ€¦ at that point, you can have them in almost all day no problem.The Sound quality thoâ€¦ oh yea boiiiii!!! Iâ€™m no audiophile and I havenâ€™t owned many truly wireless earphones in my life (Iâ€™m coming from the first generation Samsung Galaxy buds from my days on Androidâ€¦ new Apple member here)â€¦ but these things KICK! I can never really comfortably listen to anything beyond 3/4 volume and I hear everything clearlyâ€¦ mids, highs and lowsâ€¦ and those Lows (drools)â€¦ some truly head thumping bass (depending on the genre). I feel the music, especially in bass heavy tunes.This is also the first time Iâ€™m experiencing active noise cancelling, and trust me, it worksâ€¦ while it doesnâ€™t block out all noise in the spectrum,  it definitely blocks out mostâ€¦ itâ€™s like youâ€™re transported into your own little zone. Itâ€™s like I canâ€™t do without it most times when Iâ€™m home or in an environment where my attention or awareness isnâ€™t necessary and I can literally just â€œzone outâ€ to another space.The battery also lasts forever! I pretty much charge them a couple times a week, and thatâ€™s with active noise cancelling turned on.To be fair though there are a couple of things to note: there is no wireless charging (I donâ€™t really use that anyway)â€¦ itâ€™s bad for the lifespan of your battery due to heat and is way slower than using a cable. The case also definitely feels cheap compared to the AirPods Pro and Gen 3. The cases for those are definitely a cut aboveâ€¦ the case for the Beats has this little â€œcreakyâ€ wobble to it thatâ€™s unlike the usual tight tolerances and quality Iâ€™ve come to appreciate for apple products. The case is also a little bigger than the other AirPods, but it fits in my pockets daily just fine.All in allâ€¦ itâ€™s a top notch and feature rich pair of earbuds, and for my use where I value sound quality (deep base without sacrificing clarity or much balance), need a secure pair of earbuds for exercising, and the ability to hear my music over the world around me, these were definitely worth it. I canâ€™t go anywhere without themâ€¦ especially since it is baked into the apple ecosystem so I can seamlessly switch between my phone and iPad without even realizing itâ€¦ like magic as usual.Trust mi! If youâ€™re an active personâ€¦ apple or android (most features work for both), get these and done.In closing I would definitely go for the AirPods Gen 3 though if you want something even more comfy, especially since they are cheaper. However, bare in mind that they are less secure in your ears and although they do sound pretty darn good, due to physics (theyâ€™re not in ear style earbuds) they wonâ€™t give you as great a seal and will not give you the sound quality of the Beats (but due to updated design they do give the AirPods Proâ€™s a run for their money)â€¦ youâ€™ll also not get active noise cancelling and of course they only make sense to get if you have an iPhone."
4,Verified Purchase,Great Audio & Functionality But...,These are absolutely fabulous sound and features hands down probably the best and pricing is also great.But I bought these because I wanted to use them with during exercise on an elliptical machine in the gym along with some resistance workout.The problem I found  is that the earbud material is slick and not textured so was you sweat the earbuds start to itch and become wet as you try to resolve the itch. This makes them slippery and the fall out with minimal exercise body movement.If Apple wants to improve this product the could could resolve the issue by texturizing the the rubber portion of these earbuds so they stay in OR change the material and shape to Memory Foam.My 2 Cents.
4,Verified Purchase,Best sports earbuds.,"I was extremely surprised by the sound quality of these earbuds without any help from a EQ from the app, although I have a third party EQ app that is nothing but the truth with the high volume and superior sound quality these earbuds bring I don't have to use it, I have a android phone so I don't get all the features the H1 chip provides, I'm good with that mainly because I only care about sound which these sounds a lot better than the new Bose QC , Sony S link, Jabra elite 7, and a whole host of others, JBL and Soundcore is still my favorite earbuds however the Beats fit pro is right there to whole it's own as far as sound quality, noise cancellation, ambient sound, volume, battery life is solid, they feel very light in my ears and they stay in place without me having to adjust them, the only thing I wish they could do is give you full control of all the features on the earbuds, meaning if you want volume on the ear control, you can't have noise cancellation and ambient control on the earbuds, it's either one or the other, I prefer to have the noise cancellation on mine because I can control the volume on my phone, at first I thought my earbuds was defective because the sound was entirely to low, I had to go into the app change the long press settings to volume then hold the right button to reach the max volume then I'd change the settings back to noise cancellation for the long press,  because of the physical button's I will use these earbuds everyday for work and workouts at the gym. For anyone on the fence about these is a solid buy, I promise you will not be disappointed, a lot of earbuds with a much higher price point can't come close to these earbuds, including with their app support, 2023 is near, and most likely they will probably come out with a upgraded version, you shouldn't buy just to have what's current, just wait for the firmware update, it's free"
4,Verified Purchase,Almostâ€¦,"Okay so I almost love these ðŸ˜© The color is amazing, the sound quality is up to par with what youâ€™d expect from Beats, but the case is lacking! ðŸ˜– I have a pair of PowerBeats Pro and I love them, but I wanted something more discreet. The case for my PBs is much bigger and heavier and you can feel the difference in quality. Iâ€™ve dropped my PBs 1000x and my case is still intact and functional. This case feels like cheap plastic and itâ€™s almost too light. I feel like if I drop it it will just be demolished. Def get a case protector if you plan on using these on a daily basis. Thatâ€™s my only complaint. But after having my PBs for so long Iâ€™m just underwhelmed by the case quality. Maybe thatâ€™s not so bad but def not a 5 star product. Okay Iâ€™m done. I do like them a whole lot."
5,Verified Purchase,Kim does it again!,"Seriously why does Kim have her name on everything, and why do I subconsciously like her stuff!! I almost didnt buy them BECAUSE they were associated with the Kardashians! But I bought these because my AirPods died and I didnâ€™t want to spend $250 on new ones. A few people have recommended the Beats to me, and Iâ€™m glad they did because they work really well! They connect seamlessly to my iPhone and to my laptop - you can also change the settings to make them noise canceling or not. My husband has the regular beats that cost $100, and Iâ€™ve noticed the Kim beats have a few bonus features. I bought these on sale for $150 and I think it was a good deal. I donâ€™t think I would spend $200, Iâ€™d rather get the regular $100 that my husband has. I recommend buying them if theyâ€™re on sale!"
4,Verified Purchase,These were exactly what I was looking for,"Finally!! A pair of buds that actually meets all of my criteria. After trying the Bose sport buds and the Google pixel buds, both of which were tinny sounding (especially the pixel buds, which were terrible), these are awesome by comparison. They actually have some bass, which neither of the other two did. I don't listen to hip-hop just rock 'n' roll and the bass on these is not overwhelming but at least it's there. They stay in my ear really well too, but I have bigger ears. I was trying to stay in the hundred dollar range but decided to give it a try with these and I'm glad I did.  Oh, and they integrate seamlessly with the iPhone. Like I was surprised how well they connected. These things are awesome"
2,Verified Purchase,Hissing in microphone plus charging failure,"EXPANDED REVIEWI wrote my original review (3 stars) a few weeks ago and now I'm expanding it due to recent  problems and decreasing the star rating to 2 stars.ORIGINAL REVIEWThese are my first noise-canceling (NC) earphones. I'm taking a trip involving very small airplanes so baggage weight is important. I wondered whether these NC earphones could replace my Bose NC headphones. No. I'm sure it's not a fair comparison but on a scale of 0 to 10 where my headphones merit a 9, these earphones get a 4. I tested in the bathroom with the (loud) fan running. It's curious that when I turn off NC, the noise is louder than with no earphones in at all! The fan noise is somehow getting amplified through the earphones. But the NC issue is not as bad as the microphone hissing. I recorded myself on Zoom and consider these earphones unusable for that. There is a loud hiss accompanying my voice. I tried turning NC off to see if that had anything to do with it, but the hiss was still there. I sure wouldn't want to hear that, so I won't subject my friends to it. I'll stick with my Powerbeats Pro earphones for use with Zoom. So what are these Beats Fit Pro earphones good for? Listening to music. And with the modicum of NC they do provide, I bet they'll be good on bike rides. Not too much NC so you can still hear the traffic but they take the noise edge off so you can hear the music well without jacking the volume up. Plus, with my Powerbeats Pro, I'd have to unfasten my helmet strap in order to get them on. With the Beats Fit Pro, I won't have to do that; I can just stick them in. Also, Duolingo doesn't mind the microphone hiss, so I can use them for that and the modicum of NC is nice when my housemates are being noisy. (The microphone on my Bose headphones is so bad, it's unusable.) Overall, I'm ok with this purchase. I'll still bring the Bose on my trip, but these earphones will be preferred for some things I do.ADDENDUMI'm writing this a few weeks after the original review. A few days ago, I noticed that the right earbud went dead and would not charge. I thought it couldn't be a seating problem the way there is with Powerbeats earphones because these Beats Fit Pro earphones snap into the case so assertively thanks to the magnets. But I pressed on the right earbud anyway and nope, no place to go. And things got worse. When I opened the case beside my iPad, there was no indication at all, no charge status, nothing, like the iPad wasn't picking up any Bluetooth signal at all even though the case had been plugged into power all night. So I pressed the button to go into pairing mode. After a few seconds, the iPad detected the case. Right earbud 0% charge. So I plugged the case in yet again, starting to suspect that it was the case that was malfunctioning, not the earbud. A few hours later, the right earbud was up to 100%. Pressing the pairing button had somehow gotten the charging circuitry back on track. I used the earphones a lot, always noting the charge level on both as I put them away in addition to when I open the case to use them. Then yesterday I had a situation where I opened the case near the iPad, the detection dialog appeared showing the case was charged to 100% and the earbuds were charged to 100%. Then I pulled the right earbud out. When you do that, the dialog usually shows the charge status of each earbud. But in this case, it didn't. It continued to show one earbud icon at 100%, as if there had only ever been the left earbud in the case, as if the right earbud had never been there. With the dialog still showing, I returned the right earbud to the case. It snapped in because of the magnet. No change to the dialog. I then pressed on the earbud and tried to wiggle it a little. I didn't feel anything move but nevertheless, when I pulled the right earbud out again, the dialog finally showed two earbuds with the left at 100% and the right at 74% which is what I had put it away at the day before. So there's definitely something wonky about the case. I'm glad I have Applecare but the geek in me wants to continue characterizing the problem. I wonder how widespread this is."
5,Verified Purchase,The Best Bar-None,"At the time of this writing, I've been using these earbuds heavily for 3-months straight with zero issues. They hold up for everything: exercise, casual use, phone calls, you name it. The wings do a fantastic holding the buds secure (especially for when I go running), and are easy to disengage when they become a bit uncomfortable (for me, after about 2 hours). The battery life is uncanny, holding a charge for hours on end well beyond what I thought was capable. Overtop of all of this is fantastic sound quality and great controls for noise cancellation and transparency modes. Easily the best earbuds (or headphones, for that matter) I've ever owned. I highly recommend."
5,Verified Purchase,One of the best in-ear GYM earbuds for a non-iPhone user,"I searched for a long time to replace my Powerbeats 3, and these were what I decided on. I l need my music LOUD at the gym but don't want a bulky set of over-ear headphones, and these do the trick. Compared to my Pixel Buds, these get twice as loud, and compared to my Powerbeats 3, these get louder as well. The sound is the typical bass-forward profile all beats are, but not overwhelming. My gym visits consist mostly of EDM and some rap, but the sound profile listening to country or lofi is still very balanced and enjoyable.I was initially hesitant to commit to a pair that has Apple's tech inside, but I found that they have released an app on the android play store that allows you 99% of the same configuration that an iPhone user has. I can confirm that the connectivity with my Pixel 6 Pro is flawless.The noise canceling for such a low-profile set of buds is astonishing- especially after daily driving Pixel buds and Powerbeats 3, both of which have zero noise canceling tech in them.The fit is great, again, compared to my Pixel buds that constantly fall out; I rarely have to readjust these. The hook that pushes into the crook of your ear keeps them firmly in place.Once I took a fine-point sharpie to the red lettering, the black-on-black combo matched the low-profile look I strive for.Battery life is also fantastic. The case holds a ton of charges. I can go more than seven workouts, an hour each, without having to plug in.I would be cautious to use these for use on long flights or other leisurely activities as their tight fit isn't the most comfortable over 3+ hours. A more comfortable over-ear set would be the better move."
4,Verified Purchase,"Great quality, sorry battery life.","The first pair I ordered got stolen so I was sent a replacement. The quality of the sound and the noise cancellation were excellent, as I expected from the brand, but the battery life I'm sorry to say leaves much to be desired. I have an old pair of Studio 3s that have a more efficient battery life than these buds and I bought the buds because the Studio 3s were falling apart [still functional]. It seems like the buds are at 100% but die after only two or three hours, and I'm constantly having to put them in the case to charge, which also has a sorry battery life, even when idle. I don't foresee myself using these on a long flight."
4,Verified Purchase,Something wasnâ€™t right!!,"This is the fifth time I have purchased these headphones. I have broken one pair, gave the rest to my wife and kids. Well, I ordered the same as usual. Got them out to sync, no power. Plugged them in and no charging light.  Requested a replacement and got them two days later. When I went to open the box, I had to peel the little strips off both sides of the bottom. Thatâ€™s when it dawned on me, I didnâ€™t remove the security strips on the dead beats. (No pun intended) the shipping box looked normal and did not looked tampered with.  When I opened the replacement, it synced right away. So Iâ€™m guessing there was a swap somewhere.  Love the product."
5,Verified Purchase,Best for Working Out!,"I returned a lot of different headphones and ones that came highly recommended for working out because they all fell out of my ears even during light activity. Finally, these beats with the wing tips feel secure, don't hurt my ears and I'm not fussing with them my whole workout.The noise cancellation and sound quality are awesome, but I had to give it a 4 because if you're expecting quality from something over ear or true noise cancelling headphones like a Bose, you won't find that hear. However, for working out they do a great job of both and the sound quality is really great. You just have to know what to expect when getting earbuds for walking or physical activity.Great product and would highly recommend, especially if you have had difficulty finding a good earbud fit that will stay in your ear."
5,Verified Purchase,Best of the best!,"I have to say, as a faithful Apple customer, Iâ€™ve had the AirPods and the AirPod Pros and these - HANDS DOWN - are the best wireless earbuds that Iâ€™ve ever used. The noise cancellation is stellar (I can now sit in the Living Room while my son and husband are playing a video game on the TV AND not hear the constant gunfire, fight scenes, or their yelling at the screen.) Theyâ€™re comfortable for extended usage (8+ hours with no problem) and hold a great charge! If youâ€™re tired of having your earbuds fall out with the slightest of movement, scared that one may fall out on your run or outside taskâ€¦ get these! You will not be sorry."
5,Verified Purchase,Superior to AirPods Pro IMO,"As someone who is heavily in the Apple Ecosystem (iPad, iPhone, MacBook Pro, AppleTVs, etc), I wanted to love the AirPods Pro.  Unfortunately, just like their standard AirPods, they do not stay in my ear, no matter the type of tip I've tried (and I'm not talking about working out, just normal walking and even sitting at my desk for extended periods).  Because I wanted the instant pairing and intelligent device switching by way of the H1/H2 chips, I my options were limited.  I still researched many other luxury earbuds, but these Beats Fit Pros were the logical choice.Pros:- Way better fit than AirPods Pro, stay in the ear, and are comfortable.- ANC is on par with AirPods Pro (1st gen - can't speak to 2nd gen).- H1 chip, for instant device pairing, and automatic device switching (among apple devices)- Look great, more color ways than AirPods Pro- Case chargers via USB-C- Tactile buttons for control on earbuds, no touch controls which are finicky on the AirPods ProCons:- Case is larger, and feels a bit cheap- Case does not have wireless charging- Sound fidelity is a notch below AirPods Pro, since Beats focuses on lower end."
5,Verified Purchase,So glad I switched,"These are amazing and I will never go back to my AirPods. The sound quality is so much better in my opinion. The first bass drop blew me away, so be prepared! Seriously I have never been super impressed with the quality of sound (especially the bass) in headphones before these babies. The Kim Kardashian colors are gorgeous....I got the Dune because it was a close match to my skin but all 3 are really appealing. I think they are super comfortable too...more so than the AirPods and I also really like the functions on them (pressing instead of tapping). The noise reduction is legit - you feel like you're in your own world when it's turned on. I read some other reviews about the need to redesign the plastic case and I do think that would really add to their overall appeal. The plastic feels a little cheap and I'd be afraid to drop it. A nice coated rubber would be awesome. Also if you are thinking about these, keep an eye out on Amazon because I snagged them at a $20 price drop. So pleased with this purchase!"
5,Verified Purchase,MUST BUY if you need a good mic,"I use these earbuds lightly as a mostly listen to music/podcasts in my car but I do use these every day and when I do, I don't regret it. I have an iphone 14 pro and when I take these out of the case, they connect to my phone INSTANTLY. I don't use these to exercise but I'm sure if I did they would be very secure in my ears. I usually use these for about 10-30 mins at a time to quickly watch/listen to something privately. There's an exception to that though: I work remote at a call center 2 days a week, and use these earbuds to talk to and hear customers. I have gotten 0 complaints. In fact, when I tried using one of those trucker headsets, the customer said they could barely hear me then I switched to these and the customer said they could hear me MUCH better. I used to have the original airpod pros and I had to yell for customers to hear me but with these I can hear customers perfectly and I can talk normally with no issues.Noise cancelling: I don't use it for 2 reasons. 1-I don't need it. I'm most scenarios, it's important for me to be able to hear what's around me so I almost always use transparency. 2-The noise cancelling is horrible. I can easily hear outside sounds, it's barely different than using no mode at all.TLDR:If you take phone calls a lot with earbuds-buy these, they have a great mic and audio. If you have an iphone, buy these. If you don't need noise cancelling, buy these."
5,Verified Purchase,Comfortable and complimentary nude tones,"I am not a fan of wireless earbuds  They are either too bulky, fall out my ear, or are oddly shaped, IMO.  I purchased these because the nude tones were much more discrete than having something bright white sticking out of my ears.  Love the nude colors that compliments my skin tone - I purchased the Dune color and am satisfied with the overall look.The sound quality is excellent.  Noise cancellation is decent - it does not block every sound, but I'm not sure what the level of expectation is here.  It does definitely cut out background noise like cars driving, but I can still hear people talking in the same room.  The fit works for me without falling out when walking, however I have not tried working out or running with them.  I'm not confident they would stay since they have slipped out of my ear twice so far, once while walking and once while sitting.  I'll update if I decide to test during a workout.  My ear does become a bit sore at times, but that may just be me.  Batter life is decent - 6 hours before needing to charge again - they recharge rather quickly in the case.  Overall, I am satisfied with the product."
4,Verified Purchase,They’re semi easy to hide,I purchased these so they wouldn’t be as visible as my airpods especially when I wear my head scarves but I should’ve purchased one shade lighter. The sound is fine though I only wear one at a time. The color and feel of the packaging is nice and they work fine enough but I think I like my regular airpods better. These actually kind of hurt my ears when I have them in for like 20min and they seem to move sometimes. I use them all the time but I wouldn’t purchase them again because the price is too much for them not to be super comfortable.
5,Verified Purchase,Great sound and so far they're bullet proof,"I've had these headphones several months now, after previously burning through a couple JayBird products.  These headphones are nice and certainly integrate into the Apple family of products quite well.  The  sound quality is excellent and I've used them on numerous workouts.  The headphones  are pretty tough, thus far, considering that I put out a bit of sweat when working out.  If I could give them one ding,  the battery charging case needs more grip.  If you have wet hands from working out the case feels like it's coated in ice and easily slips out of your hands.  Despite that, this is an outstanding product!"
4,Verified Purchase,Finally they Don't fall out!!,"Very sturdy, don't fall out, sounds is good, noise canceling is good, handing in and out of case and placing in ear is superb. Will cause ear fatigue and possible soars if you do not keep ears and buds clean or wear for long time and not adjust or take out to let's ears rest. Physical buttons male them better than touch sensitivity because can operate while wearing a hat. These are a must buy. Plus they match my skin tone. I've been waiting for this design for years."
5,Verified Purchase,Durable and awesome!,"OK - I normally don’t leave reviews, especially this long after purchase, but… These earbuds are awesome!  Great sound and outstanding noise cancelling.  I use them whether I’m working out, in an airplane, or in my tractor.  Excellent wherever you want to listen to music / podcast or a movie.  Here is the kicker - after my last work trip I left them in the pocket of my pants.  Yes - didn’t discover until after the full wash and dry cycles!  Was not hopeful, but in to the bag of rice went the case and earbuds.  2 weeks later, pulled them out, plugged in to charger for a few minutes, then tried them out.  Work like they are brand new!  Could not believe, and am now a forever fan of these incredible earbuds.  Outstanding sound and durable beyond expectations!"
4,Verified Purchase,"Great sound, but miss wireless charging","Compared to my older Airpod Pros, the sound and noise cancellation are ver good. It’s hard to believe this is an Apple sub as they are a superior competitor.  Wasn’t sure about the wing tips, but these earbuds are very comfortable for me.  But I do miss the wireless charging.  Phone, watch and earbuds would go on my beside charging station at the end of the day and conveniently be ready to go.  That’s why I held back a star.  I’m pleased with the price, but I must have timed it just right.  Only paid $149 and now I see them at $199."
5,Verified Purchase,Happy with my purchase! Better than Apple's ear pods!,"The reason why I like these better than Apple's ear pods is due to the tiny hook that secures the earbud in your ear. I have trouble with one ear, due to a smaller-than-normal ear canal.  As a result, the Apple ear pods and Sony (even with the smallest rubber connector) fall out or feel like they're going to fall out. Fortunately, I don't have that same sensation with these. Very happy with my purchase! Love the battery life."
5,Verified Purchase,Better than AirPod Pros,"Fit and comfort are about the same between both, have had both for about the same amount of time, but my AirPod pros have now started rattling a few times now. Apple no longer replaces pods with internal rattling even though it’s a manufacturing defect. But I’ve had no such issue with the Beats at all and fully recommend them over the airpods!"
5,Verified Purchase,Looooove these!!,"I had AirPods, but kind of hated them; I have small ears and they fall out, but was annoyed at the thought of going back to something without the user friendly experience of using all Apple products. After reading the info, I ordered these and realized they work seamlessly with my iPhone and iPad (prob since Apple owns Beats now). These stay in very well with the little ear clip and the noise cancellation works amazingly well - even on super noisy flights. So glad I purchased these!!"
5,Verified Purchase,Comfort,"The earbuds feel great, the sound on them is good not to much Bass which is great. In the box it has more of the eartips in the box so if it feels a bit loose you can just change them till it fits your ear.Great product for people who are looking for comfort.I would personally buy them again."
5,Verified Purchase,3 months and still completely satisfied,"I was looking for a pair of earbuds that could handle serious running, but also work with all of my Apple devices as seamlessly as possible and also work well for flying. It seemed like way too much to ask for, but these check every box. I have run over 800 miles with them and they sound great and keep me safe with the sound pass through. The battery life is amazing with 5-6 hours in ear before charging. Noise cancellation is perfect on planes. Best of all, the seamless moving of them between my iPhone, iPad and MacBook is on par with AirPods, with better sound and far better fit for running."
4,Verified Purchase,Best Earbuds I have tried - but experience marred by charging issue,What I like:* good fit* great sound* noise cancellation OK* use within the Apple Ecosystem - good integration and most of the time it's easy to move between devices and PCNot So Good:* having trouble with charging left earbud.  It does not reliably start charging when placed in case.  There is nothing on the contacts and yet I have to remove and reinsert the earbuds several times before it will charge.Will likely exchange these since they are giving me trouble already after only a few weeks.
5,Verified Purchase,Fantastic sound,"These are the best wireless ear buds I have ever tried. The noise cancellation is great and the case is also a charger. The battery life is better than my phone, it lasts for days! They have a piece of rubber on them to fit your ears. They are not coming out. Perfect for all activities!"
4,Verified Purchase,"Decent, connects easily, but not sure about the price tag","I like how easily they synced with my iPhone and my garmin watch. I also like that I don’t hear that horrible foot fall in my ears when running. They are reasonably comfortable and stay in quite well.After about an hour I start to feel a little discomfort. I find I’m not getting a great seal despite using the smallest rubber attachments provided (there are 3 sizes provided). In breezy and especially windy weather, the wind sound gets quite loud and drowns out what I’m listening to. Also, when walking / running near traffic, I find it does not compete well. The case is definitely on the larger/bulkier size but not too heavy. In fact the lid feels a little flimsy.Overall they’re decent, especially for how well they sync, stay in the ear, and I don’t hear the hard foot fall doof sound, but not so sure they’re worth the hefty price tag."
5,Verified Purchase,Love these!,"I love flesh colored accessories and clothes. Sometimes I just want to have earbuds in that people can’t actively see. Especially at work or while driving. The law here says we can have one earbud in. Sometimes I pop one in while having phone conversations since my Jeep can be so loud. These fit in my ears great and they stay in place! I can’t preach to other brands like AirPods, but the quality is great. You won’t regret this purchase."
4,Verified Purchase,Bought these for my wife at Xmas,Coming from the older Apple wired ear phones to these where a huge upgrade for her.  It fits her small ears perfectly and the sound is great.  Best thing - no more wires to get tangled up!  She loves them (I got her the purple color).  Very good purchase.
5,Verified Purchase,Worth the money,"These earbuds are very comfortable in addition to being great sound quality, cancelling noise & play hour after hour. I have only had them a week but so far so good. The only thing I am disappointed about is they went on sale this week for $50 less than what I paid. Worth the money!"
4,Verified Purchase,Love them!,I had researched which beats had the best bass and it said the “beats fit pro” and they did not disappoint. They are soooo sound proof and have great quality! The only downside is the fit. I have really small ears for an adult lol and even the smallest earbuds (it comes with 3 different sizes) falls out of my ears but still worth the money to me! I would recommend!

5,Verified Purchase,Works Great,"Ear buds are definitely as advertised. However, they do contain a material that is causing an allergic reaction to my ears. Not Beats fault, but something to be aware of. Unfortunately I have to transition back to my AirPods Pro, which are inferior to the Beats!"

4,Verified Purchase,I like them,"I really like them and the color but they sound pretty much like a $20 pair earbuds I bought from Walmart, sound isn't excellent but is good so I'll keep them..I wouldn't recommend for this price tho.. maybe at $100."

5,Verified Purchase,"Expensive, but worth it!","These are for sure pricy, but definitely worth it in my opinion!I love the connectivity with apple and beats, works great on my phone when adjusting them via general app.Huge fan of the three modes the earbuds come with! Transparency and noise cancellation are awesome. Never had another pair of noise-cancellation earbuds/headphones so I have no comparison, but these work fantastic!I go to a gym where it's pretty loud with music/people and these cut it all out except some light music, which I can't blame the earbuds, it is super loud in there. But if you play your own music, it laps right over it and you won't even noise it's playing.Will use these for as long as they last, they're sweat proof which is great on a push day and have never ever fallen out of my ears.Super happy with these, glad I purchased them."

5,Verified Purchase,Excelentes,"La verdad me sorprendieron estos audífonos, adicional de lo normal que sería la cancelación de ruido que es bastante buena y el sonido de calidad que tiene, me percaté que me lee mis mensajes de WhatsApp y me notifica cuando hay publicaciones de Instagram de los usuarios que tengo activas la notificación.Sugiero que es mejor comprarlos si tienes iPhone ya que en otros celulares no tiene estas opciones. Y comprarles un protector o estuche para conservar el cargador.También muestra la batería del estuche y de cada audífono individualmente. La batería dura un montón con una carga los puedo utilizar una semana completa."

4,Verified Purchase,"Great Sound, Not Noise Canceling","The Beats Fit Pro - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds - Apple H1 Headphone Chip, Compatible, provide great stereo sound, good bass, and they're easy to pair to your phone or PC. They fit comfortably in my ears, so I can leave them in for quite a while. They come with three different-sized earbud tips. Make sure to return them to their case after use, and the battery life is fantastic. I would love to have given these earbuds a five-star rating, but I bought them because I need noise-cancelling earbuds, and these are not. I can hear my husband breathing at night, never mind his snoring."

5,Verified Purchase,Fits better then AirPods pro,Love these headphones they literally stay in your ear doing anything. I went on a 4.5 mile walk and did not have to adjust them at all. When i used my AirPods for walks they kept falling out.
,,,
5,Verified Purchase,I have owned over a dozen different variations of Beats.,"I’m a big fan of the noise canceling. The sound quality is amazing 9.5 out of 10 for in ear buds. I have the Beats Flex, the Solo 2s wireless several PowerBeats with and without wires. These are the best Beats product to date. Factor in sound quality, size, simplicity and volume are the best."

5,Verified Purchase,"10/10 earbuds, 3/10 case","I've had these for about ten weeks now. I use them for blocking the construction happening in the building next to mine (it is very successful, to my surprise), taking calls with loved ones (the mic was apparently a massive improvement on a couple of Pixel (4 XL) and Samsung phones I had in a couple of different cases), and listening to music, podcasts, and my PS4 for films, cartoons, and video games where audio is key. They pair seamlessly and I've only had trouble with connecting if I've forgotten to turn disconnect them from another device. (They will only pair with one device at a time.) I didn't like the little plastic nubs it came with (although I was glad to see they were the same color as the rest of the headphones; I love this hue), so I put in some foam ones I had from other earbuds instead. The noise cancellation is weaker for it because it's further from an airtight seal with my ear due to the foam, but I find it worth it to have that for the comfort in my inner ear. Overall they're pretty comfortable; I've noticed some slight soreness after long 5+ hour flights but that's it, and there are enough variations on exactly how they sit in your ear to ease one sore spot while still keeping the buds in. I've never felt like they might fall out of my ears regardless of bud tips, which was a big requirement for me. I love these so much I convinced my partner to get a pair too.I don't like that the case is a) so slippery b) seems easily scratched and c) is so lightweight. The buds don't magnetize into their charging positions as other earbuds I've had do and the case has a tendency to feel like at any given moment my attempt to juggle it like wet soap will fail and it will fall and inevitably break because it's so fragile. I wound up making a case for my case. It's silly.I had to get a $13 dongle (which included an old 3.5mm headphone dongle; i got the zamia for PS4) to connect this newer Bluetooth technology to my PS4 and my 2013 MacBook Pro, which was successful on the PS4 for audio and mic but only effective for audio (no mic) on my laptop."

5,Verified Purchase,"Very Nice, Great Quality",I really needed this for my Bible study and I wanna try them at the gym too. They were easy to connect I love how sleek and smooth they’re nice quality also the come with different sizes of to the parts that goes in your ear it’s really hidden though.
