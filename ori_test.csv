It is very loud and doesn't swing very well. It is beautiful though. I love the colors and it has a lot of settings, but I don't think it was worth the money."
4,__label1__,4,N,Office Products,B003822IRA,Casio MS-80B Standard Function Desktop Calculator,Great computing!,I was looking for an inexpensive desk calcolatur and here it is. It works and does everything I need. Only issue is that it tilts slightly to one side so when I hit any keys it rocks a little bit. Not a big deal.
5,__label1__,4,N,Beauty,B00PWSAXAM,Shine Whitening - Zero Peroxide Teeth Whitening System - No Sensitivity,Only use twice a week,"I only use it twice a week and the results are great. I have used other teeth whitening solutions and most of them, for the same results I would have to use it at least three times a week. Will keep using this because of the potency of the solution and also the technique of the trays, it keeps everything in my teeth, in my mouth."

Keeps drinks warm or cold for a good period of time, and its very sturdy. I get complements on how sleek it looks all the time, especially because it doesnt leave fingerprints. Highly recommend. Only suggestion when washing the lid, be sure to shake it and dry well to prevent dripping when the lid is on the tumbler."

15,__label1__,4,N,Furniture,B0019QITHK,"Boss Caressoft Medical Stool, black",Color Is Accurate,"I bought 2 of these in brown for my island. The hydraulic mechanism looks as though it might fail with over use, but otherwise, I really like them. The color is accurate, as is the description. There is some padding, but not much. Definitely not a chair that you would lounge around in, but great for a bar/counter in the kitchen."

17,__label1__,4,Y,Camera,B00E56WY18,"Falcon Zero F360 HD DVR Dual Dash Cam, Rear View Mirror, 1080p, 32GB SD Card (Black)","Good design, but a recommendation","Video quality if superb, fits just fine, looks like a real mirror (I believe they enhanced this), my only gripe is I wish they put the cameras not side by side, but one on one side, the other on the other side. I only say this because due to where the left camera is place, there is wasted recording room when you start to turn it towards the driver side. Otherwise very happy with this so far."
18,__label1__,4,N,Sports,B000HE8NK8,Barnett Diablo Slingshot,good enough,"As sling shots go, this is good enough for my purposes. Though, I would have preferred for the handle to be slimmer for better grip."
19,__label1__,4,Y,Kitchen,B00FJKEGRY,Cuisavour's Deluxe Spiral Slicer with Japanese Stainless Steel Blades and 2 Premium Julienne Sizes,I just wish that there were guides and manuals for this,"just to be fair, i really believe that this is a great slicer , and the idea was there, but unfortunately there are tricks when using this spiral slicer, i mean manual or something would have been helpful.<br /><br />I'm not saying something negative about this slicer because it does work, but however it did it took me almost a week in trying to learn how to use this slicer in cutting different kinds of vegetable.<br />the price i may say is fair, but i do wish that there were manuals in every box in showing us how to use this slicer properly."

(Second only to my Nike flip-flops,"These are literally my second favorite shoes. (Second only to my Nike flip-flops!). They are so comfy. I have noticed a little bunching, getting a little slouchy around the ankles, but I think that may be because of my larger than average calves and regular ankles. BY the way, the normal size fits my muscular calves quite well. I wear a size 10 and size 10 fits perfectly. Would definitely buy Dr. Scholl's boots again."
20982,__label2__,5,Y,Shoes,B00APWMC90,"Vasque Women's Skadia Ultradry Snow Boot,Jet Black/White,10 M US",Great boot,"Got these just in time to hike on snow-covered gravel road. They were warm and had great traction. Best of all, they are quick and easy to lace up- just wind them around the hooks and off you go. I sometimes wear a 9 1/2, but mainly a 10. I got the 10 and they fit great. There was no break-in needed- my feet felt fine after their first workout."
20983,__label2__,2,Y,Shoes,B00IA6US7G,"West Blvd Womens LIMA MOCCASIN Boots 3-Layer Fringe Tribal Indian Winter Faux Suede Leather Shoes ,Black Su ,10",Good thing they are only for one outfit to have ...,"These run I would say two sizes smaller than what they are. Not true to size at all. My daughter is always a 9 and I ordered one size up and it was still a VERY tight fit. Good thing they are only for one outfit to have pictures taken in, because she said they are made so poorly they event hurt to walk in. &#34;Look&#34; okay, fit and wearing them are a different story. But you do get what you pay for and they are cheap and cheaply made. For a one occasion shoe, no big deal I guess."
20984,__label2__,5,Y,Shoes,B00MI6FOFU,Journee Collection Womens Regular Sized and Wide-Calf Studded Knee-High Riding Boot Taupe 7.5 Wide Calf,I absolutely love these boots,I absolutely love these boots. I have large calves and always have a hard time finding boots to fit. I bought the &#34;wide calf&#34; size and they fit great. They are very warm and very comfortable!!

But I have to say, I gave it a 3-star because they KILL my feet! And they make me stand at an angle like I am about to tumble forward. If you can deal with sore feet and like cute shoes, these are for you."

20988,__label2__,5,Y,Shoes,B000GLP63O,"Ray-Ban 4075P Rectangular Wrap Sunglasses,Black Frame/Green Polarized Lens,61 mm",Fantastic and well worth the price!,"It's tough to find a good pair of sunglasses. After going years with cheap $20 pairs, I decided to look for a good upgrade and spend a bit extra. Well, this pair is near flawless. Great design - a lens that's large enough to not bother your peripheral vision, yet not too large to cover up your face. The sides are thick, so you get a bit of privacy from people viewing you from the side (i.e. when you take a nap on the bus.) Also, something to note is the way it sits on your face, obviously there are different shaped faces, but for me, the glasses sit far enough away so it doesn't press on your cheeks when you move your mouth or smile. The contact points are the sides of the ear and bridge of the nose - perfect. They also have a nice green tint to them, very subtle and providing a good amount of shading. They're also polarized, which adds to the cost, but increases the benefit. They also come with a large case, a little minus because it's so large, but they're specifically made for these so they won't get bent or crushed. Give these a try, I think you'll be quite happy you did."
20989,__label2__,5,Y,Shoes,B006NNZM92,TRG the One Shoe Cream 50ml #114 Light Gray,Good stuff,Revived a pair of Birkenstock Londons that I'd given up for lost. Now they look almost new. The shoe cream goes on evenly and does not look shiny or waxy.

20991,__label2__,5,Y,Shoes,B00IAELO9O,"Skechers Womens Career-9 To 5 Flats Shoes,Black,8.5",Amazing,These shoes are absolutely amazing. They are the most comfortable work shoes I have purchased in a long time.
20992,__label2__,4,Y,Shoes,B00CY8PQUU,"Luichiny Women's Trend Lee Boot,Black,7 M US",AMAZING BOOTS / GREAT PRICE,"These boots are an AMAZING alternative to the SW 5050 boot.  I ordered both, and frankly I prefer this one. The quality is just as good and the price is better, another imporatant factor for me personally is the calf circum. My calfs are only 12 inches, so these boots fit better then the SW 5050 boots, which have a 14 in circum.<br /><br />The only reason I am not giving these boots five stars is that even with jeans and boot socks, these boots are still slightly loose on me. I really wish there was a narrow calf option with an 11 or 12 inch circum. so that I could get a more fitted look.<br /><br />I highly recommend these boots! I can't wait to wear them! Just be mindful if you have very skinny legs that these will be slighly loose."
20993,__label2__,1,Y,Shoes,B00AO3EELY,"Saucony Men's Hurricane 15 Running Shoe,White/Black/Green,12.5 M US",It is too white!,"My son had ordered it but when it arrived, he instantly hated it. In the pictures it looks quite different from what it actually looks."

Double leather bottom so I will wear it everywhere except when walking on street or side walk, because I dont want to wear it down, It also has an inner sole pad.

20999,__label2__,5,Y,Shoes,B00748YHVE,Ariat Womens Unbridled Fatbaby 9 B Powder Brown,"This fit well, comfortable, best investment",I wish these were a little more durable. I got it caught on a bolt crossing the bunk feeding calves. Ripped a big hole no problem on the of the color part of the boot.  I broke these boots in barefooted they rock I love them. Got another pair for good. They need to make these in purpleüòä
21000,__label2__,4,Y,Shoes,B00A46KTLU,"VIBRAM FIVEFINGERS SPEED XC MENS HIKING SHOES, Black/yellow 44 M EU","Love these shoes, except for the laces","I've been looking for a replacement for my beloved KSO treks (owned two since I found them), and I was also looking for a water-resistant toe shoe to ride in the rain and walk in puddles.  These looked like they would work and aside from an initial mistake in sizing (advice elsewhere said they ran small, but the one I ordered first was way too big, so I reordered my regular and they fit), I love them.  Still miss the KSO trek's soft leather feel (especially the sole), but these will do.  The laces are a pain, and they do come undone sometimes, and the heel chafed at first so I had to wear bandaids until I toughened up, but I think these will have to be my KSO Trek replacements for now until Vibram reissues them (please oh  please!)."
